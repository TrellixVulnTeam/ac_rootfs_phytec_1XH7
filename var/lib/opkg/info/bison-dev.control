Package: bison-dev
Version: 3.0.4-r0
Description: GNU Project parser generator (yacc replacement) - Development files
 Bison is a general-purpose parser generator that converts an annotated
 context-free grammar into an LALR(1) or GLR parser for that grammar.
 Bison is upward compatible with Yacc: all properly-written Yacc grammars
 ought to work with Bison with no change. Anyone familiar with Yacc should
 be able to use Bison with little trouble.  This package contains symbolic
 links, header files, and related items necessary for software
 development.
